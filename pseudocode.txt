	1.2 Get the element by id named "countryNameBox","populationBox","areaBox","popDensityBox","flagBox", "countryNameList","areaIn","popRadio" 
		AND store them in corresponding variables named countryName, population, areaBox, popDensityBox, flag, userchoice, userChoiceArea, 			userChoiceDensity
	1.3 Declare a variable name indexCountry to Store the index of a selected country.
2. Load data from local storage and parse data into an variable "countriesArray"
3. Add event listeners for dropbox, button and radio button to call function DisplayCountryData

		4.3.4 RETURN the value of areaNumber
	
	4.4 function named "CalPopDensity" to calculate population density by miles or km
		4.4.1 Declare a variable name "popDen"
		4.4.2 IF user checked on the option of miles
		      THEN calculate popDen by get the population value of the selected country divide to area value of the selected country
		4.4.3 ELSE IF user checked on the option of Kilometer 
		      THEN calculate popDen by get the population value of the selected country divide to the muliple of area value of the 
			selected country and 2.589988
		4.4.4 RETURN the value of popDen
	
	4.5 function named "DisplayCountryData" to display data of a selected country
